# RPG-Project
 
This is a WIP. The project aims to be a **turn based RPG** with **rogue like** features. 

The player starts with a selected character and as they progress though the game, they can claim new characters. 
Each character is an **ability** the player can use in their turn, however every character has it's own life bar and there is perma death. 
In the player's turn they can change the active character, in other words, they can select which character is going to take the next damage.

There's a map **randomly generated** where the player moves throgh, room by room. There they can encounter **enemies, chests, rest sites and maybe some NPCs** with extra dialogue.

Every enemy room and chest room drops an **equipable item**, linked to a specific character or to the entire party, giving them **stat boosts** and **special effects**.

The player must progress through the game looting better equipment as the enemies get tougher. The game ends when the player defeats the final boss (wins), or lose all their characters (loses).

NOTE: As previously stated, this project is in the works, so not every mechanic is implemented in the current version. This is what we aim for the completed project to be.
